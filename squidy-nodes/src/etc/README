	### Demo Pipeline ###
	
	- startSquidy_Demo.bat / startSquidy_Demo.sh: This will start the

	  same wireless / internet connection. On your iPhone, go to 'Settings' ->
	  'Squidy Client' and enter the IP of you PC as host.
	  
	- Run both the Squidy App on your iPhone and the pipeline on your PC
	
	- You will now be able to control your PC mouse via your iPhone. You can
	  furthermore control Powerpoint presentations by swiping to the right /
	  left in order to access the next / previous slide (Swiping maps to the
